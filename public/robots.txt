# As always, Asimov's Three Laws are in effect:
# 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human
#    being to come to harm.
# 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such
#    orders would conflict with the First Law.
# 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does
#    not conflict with the First or Second Law.
